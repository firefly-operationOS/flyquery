"""TableResolver — map AST table names to their current parquet snapshot paths.

Given a dataset_id and a list of unqualified table names (as reported by
``AstClassifier``), looks up each table's active ``schema_snapshots`` row
and returns a ``{name: absolute_parquet_path}`` dict. This dict is passed
directly to ``DuckDBExecutor.execute`` as ``attached_tables``.

Path construction
-----------------
* ``object_store_base`` is the root of the blob store (e.g. ``/var/lib/flyquery/blobs``
  for LocalFs or ``s3://my-bucket/flyquery`` for S3).
* ``parquet_object_key`` is the relative path stored in ``flyquery_schema_snapshots``
  (e.g. ``flyquery/ten-a/ws-id/ds-id/tables/table-id/v3.parquet``).
* The full path is ``{object_store_base}/{parquet_object_key}`` regardless of
  the adapter — DuckDB's S3 httpfs support makes the s3:// scheme work
  transparently when ``duckdb_httpfs=true``.
