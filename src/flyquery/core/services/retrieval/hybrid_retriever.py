"""HybridRetriever: BM25 + pgvector with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

Fuses rankings from multiple retrieval strategies into a single ranked
list of ``Hit`` objects. When no embedder is available, degrades
gracefully to BM25-only retrieval.

Retrieval model
===============
The corpus is a **schema catalog**, not a document store. The searchable
units are ``schema_objects`` (table + column rows), and each hit carries
``(table_id, snapshot_id, column_name, data_type, description, samples)``.

* In a single pass the retriever returns four distinct hit types --
  schema_objects, approved examples, published metrics, and glossary
  terms -- each with its own top-k budget.
* Relations (approved cross-table join candidates) are loaded as a
  separate set and are not ranked.
* The scoping model is ``(workspace_id, dataset_id)`` keyed; pgvector RLS
  policies handle tenant isolation at the Postgres level.

flyquery is pgvector-only by design. Schema catalogs are small enough
that a single pgvector deployment is adequate, so no pluggable
vector-store abstraction is needed.
