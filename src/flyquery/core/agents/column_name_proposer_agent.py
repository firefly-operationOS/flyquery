"""ColumnNameProposerAgent -- turn synthetic ``columnNN`` headers into meaningful names.

When an XLSX section is materialised, DuckDB's CSV auto-detection falls
back to ``column0`` / ``column1`` / ... whenever the first row of the
section doesn't look like a header (e.g. dashboard-style XLSX where the
real "header" is a band of merged title cells far above the data
block). The synthetic names work mechanically but defeat Text-to-SQL:
the model can't reason about ``column03`` the way it can reason about
``year_2024_total`` or ``line_item``.

This agent looks at:

* the section label (Activos, Pasivo/activo, Cuenta de Pérdidas y
  Ganancias, Información de contacto, ...),
* the current synthetic column names,
* a small sample of values from each column,

and proposes business-meaningful ``snake_case`` names. The proposer is
ONLY consulted when every column name matches the synthetic
``columnNN`` pattern -- if the file's first row already provided real
headers, we keep them verbatim.

Output is a flat list of ``proposed_names`` aligned 1:1 with the
``current_names`` input. The pipeline then rewrites the Parquet
``SELECT col0 AS proposed0, col1 AS proposed1, ...`` so all downstream
stages (sample / profile / embed / Grounding / Generation / Explainer)
see the friendly names.
