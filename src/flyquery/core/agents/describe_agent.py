"""DescribeAgent — generates business-friendly descriptions + synonyms for columns.

Used in Stage 7 to populate description + synonyms_json for columns where
description IS NULL. Runs in batches capped by FLYQUERY_DESCRIBE_BATCH.
Cost is tracked per run and stops when FLYQUERY_DESCRIBE_BUDGET_CENTS_PER_RUN
is hit.

# Semantic type taxonomy. Each ingested column gets one of these
# classifications, written by the DescribeAgent alongside the
# business description + synonyms. The grounding agent, explainer,
# and SDK clients use it to render results properly (e.g. format a
# ``currency`` column with the right separator, show a ``percentage``
# with %, plot a ``date`` on a time axis, treat ``iban`` as
# PII-sensitive).
#
# The taxonomy is curated -- it leaves out long-tail physical units
# (temperature / weight / volume) because those rarely show up in
# the BvD / SaaS exports flyquery targets, and adding them dilutes
# the LLM's choice space. Add to this list deliberately, then update
# the YAML prompt + bump the prompt ``version``.
