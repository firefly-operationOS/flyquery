"""Replace FastAPI's auto-generated OpenAPI with pyfly's richer schema.

The pyfly FastAPI adapter registers every controller method behind a
single ``lazy_endpoint(request: Request)`` shim so the DI container can
resolve the controller bean on first hit. The side-effect is that
FastAPI's built-in OpenAPI introspector sees only that shim -- no
request body, no response model, no tags, no docstring.

This module bridges the gap. After the FastAPI app is built we install
a custom ``app.openapi`` callable that:

1. Collects per-route metadata from the original controller signatures
   via pyfly's :class:`ControllerRegistrar.collect_route_metadata`.
2. Renders the spec through pyfly's :class:`OpenAPIGenerator`.
3. Enriches the result with rich global tags (with business +
   technical descriptions) and the OpenAPI ``info`` block we want
   Swagger / ReDoc to display.
