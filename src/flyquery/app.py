"""PyFly application entry point for flyquery.

``scan_packages`` declares every package containing ``@configuration``,
``@rest_controller``, ``@service``, ``@command_handler``,
``@query_handler``, or ``@repository`` beans so pyfly's DI container
can discover them at boot.

Exception handlers are registered explicitly via
``flyquery.web.conventions.register_exception_handlers(app)`` in
``flyquery.main`` -- pyfly's FastAPI adapter does not scan
``@controller_advice`` beans, so the conventions handler table is
hand-wired against the FastAPI app.
