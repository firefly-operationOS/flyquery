### **Documentation**

</div>

---

The complete reference set for **flyquery**. Start with the top-level
[QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md) for your first upload + query, the main
[README.md](../README.md) for the elevator pitch, and
[payload-reference.md](payload-reference.md) for the authoritative wire-payload
guide. Come here when you need a specific corner of the system.

## Reading paths

Pick the entry point that matches what you're trying to do.

### "I just want to call the API"

1. [**../QUICKSTART.md**](../QUICKSTART.md) — ten minutes from clone to your
   first upload, ingest, and answered question. HTTP-only, no API keys required
   for format parsing.
2. [**payload-reference.md**](payload-reference.md) — composing the request:
   every wire payload (upload, query, conversation, SSE frames, RFC 7807
   errors).
3. [**api-reference.md**](api-reference.md) — every endpoint, header, query
   parameter, DTO, scope, and status code.
4. [**glossary.md**](glossary.md) — terms the API uses (dataset, table,
   snapshot, schema object, relation, example, conversation turn, ingest job, …).

### "I'm subscribing to the EDA surface"

1. [**eda-events.md**](eda-events.md) — the two topics flyquery publishes
   (`flyquery.ingest` and `flyquery.schema`), the payload on each event, the
   durable Postgres outbox default.
2. [**async-ingest.md**](async-ingest.md) — how `IngestWorker` consumes the
   `flyquery.ingest` topic, job lifecycle, cooperative cancel, retry + dead-letter.
3. [**workers.md**](workers.md) — the worker fleet topology (IngestWorker +
   RetentionWorker), CLI subcommands, scaling, recovery, and deployment forms.
4. [**architecture.md**](architecture.md) — how `pyfly.eda.EventPublisher` is
   injected into the ingestion and query services.

### "I want to understand how it works"

1. [**architecture.md**](architecture.md) — the data model, storage architecture,
   multi-tenancy, hexagonal ports, lock-step modules.
2. [**pipeline.md**](pipeline.md) — upload + 10-stage ingestion and query
   pipeline (Grounding → Generation → Critic → Explainer) end-to-end with ASCII
   diagrams; mode coupling (sync vs async via EDA).
3. [**ingestion.md**](ingestion.md) — stage-by-stage ingestion detail: each
   stage's inputs, outputs, skip policy, and SSE events.
4. [**schema-detection.md**](schema-detection.md) — XLSX/CSV/JSON parsing
   deep dive, type inference, drift detection, PII tagging, and the
   column-name proposer agent.
5. [**prompts.md**](prompts.md) — catalog of the 7 agent prompts: instruction
   text, input shape, output schema.

### "I'm running this in production"

1. [**deployment.md**](deployment.md) — reference topologies, env vars,
   migration step, health checks, observability, backup.
2. [**deployment-topology.md**](deployment-topology.md) — single-node vs
   multi-node vs HA ASCII diagrams; scaling up (more workers, Postgres separate,
   Redis separate, S3 object store).
3. [**cicd.md**](cicd.md) — CI workflows (lint, test-unit, test-integration,
   lockstep-check, publish-sdk), tag-triggered releases, branch protection.
4. [**operations-runbook.md**](operations-runbook.md) — cold start, daily
   checks, common error fixes, GDPR purge runbook, key rotation, incident
   response.
5. [**troubleshooting.md**](troubleshooting.md) — symptom → root cause → fix
   for upload failures, stuck ingest jobs, NULL embeddings, RLS returning zero
   rows, agent timeouts.

### "I'm building / extending"

1. [**architecture.md**](architecture.md) — hexagonal ports and where to plug
   new adapters (ObjectStore, FileReader, VectorStore, PiiScanner,
   SemanticCompiler).
2. [**pipeline.md**](pipeline.md) — the orchestrator and how stages are chained.
3. [**concurrency.md**](concurrency.md) — AsyncSession scoping, RLS GUC binding,
   EDA worker concurrency, DuckDB per-request isolation, ObjectStore async.
4. [**quality.md**](quality.md) — testing strategy: unit, integration,
   conformance (ObjectStore adapters), parser fixtures, pipeline tests,
   LLM-gated tests.
5. [**consumers.md**](consumers.md) — building a service that consumes flyquery:
   SDK patterns, agent-token model, idempotency, EDA subscription recipes.

### "Something broke"

1. [**troubleshooting.md**](troubleshooting.md) — symptom-first index of common
   failure modes.
2. [**operations-runbook.md**](operations-runbook.md) — step-by-step incident
   response template.
3. [**concurrency.md**](concurrency.md) — for multi-worker race conditions and
   RLS mis-configuration symptoms.

### "Designing the future"

1. [**firefly-intelligence-system.md**](firefly-intelligence-system.md) — the
   three-pillar narrative: how flycanon, flyradar, and flyquery cooperate.
2. [**integration-with-firefly-os.md**](integration-with-firefly-os.md) —
   concrete integration recipes: flyradar referencing a flyquery dataset,
   flycanon RAG over metadata about a flyquery dataset.
3. [**auto-learning.md**](auto-learning.md) — the PROPOSED → APPROVED example
   cycle and the v1 online-learning roadmap.
4. [**scale-and-performance.md**](scale-and-performance.md) — throughput
   numbers, bottlenecks, tuning knobs, capacity planning.
5. [**superpowers/specs/2026-05-22-flyquery-design.md**](superpowers/specs/2026-05-22-flyquery-design.md) — the approved design spec.

## Generating the OpenAPI spec

```bash
# Against a running service:
curl -s http://localhost:8520/openapi.json | jq

# Via the task target (writes to ./openapi.json and checks drift):
task openapi-snapshot
```

The Swagger UI at `/docs` and Redoc at `/redoc` both browse the live spec.
