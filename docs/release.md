# Release runbook

How to ship a new flyquery release. The flow is fully automated --
push a tag, watch CI -- but the local pre-flight is worth running
once so an obvious break doesn't make it past the merge.

## TL;DR

```bash
# Pre-flight (5 min)
task openapi-snapshot
task lint
task test:unit
uv run python scripts/check_lockstep.py
cd sdks/python && uv build && cd ../..      # smoke
cd sdks/java && mvn -B -q -DskipTests package && cd ../..

# Ship
git add -A
git commit -m "release: vYY.MM.PP"
git push origin main
git tag vYY.MM.PP   # e.g. v26.5.10
git push --tags
```

The tag push fans out to two workflows:
1. `docker-publish.yaml` -- multi-arch image to GHCR.
2. `publish-sdks.yaml` -- Java to GitHub Packages, Python wheel +
   sdist to the GitHub Release page.

## Pre-flight checklist (the load-bearing parts)

### 1. Version sync

Every artifact must read the same CalVer string. The five places
that hold a version literal:

| File | Pattern |
|---|---|
| `pyproject.toml` | `version = "26.5.10"` |
| `pyfly.yaml` | `pyfly.app.version: 26.5.10` |
| `sdks/python/pyproject.toml` | `version = "26.5.10"` |
| `sdks/java/pom.xml` | `<version>26.5.10</version>` |
| `Taskfile.yml` | `packageVersion=26.5.10` + `artifactVersion=26.5.10` (two occurrences) |
| `README.md` | `version-26.5.10-green` badge URL |

Note: `publish-sdks.yaml` *also* rewrites the SDK versions from the
git tag at publish time, so a forgotten local bump will not produce
a wrong-version published artifact -- but the local SDK builds in
CI's `sdk-python` / `sdk-java` jobs would still produce a 26.5.9
wheel against a 26.5.10 spec, which is confusing in the build logs.
**Bump everything locally.**

### 2. OpenAPI snapshot

The on-disk `openapi.json` is the source of truth that both SDK
generators consume. Re-snapshot after every controller change:

```bash
task openapi-snapshot
```

The drift gate at `tests/integration/test_openapi_snapshot.py` will
fail CI if you forget.

### 3. Lockstep

21 byte-equivalent files are shared with flycanon + flyradar. The
check normalises `flyquery -> flycanon` then SHA-256s the result
against pinned hashes:

```bash
uv run python scripts/check_lockstep.py
```

If this fails, do NOT just rebump the pin -- the change has to land
in canon / radar first.

### 4. SDK regen + builds

```bash
task sdk:python   # rebuild Python SDK
task sdk:java     # rebuild Java SDK
cd sdks/python && uv build && cd ../..
cd sdks/java && mvn -B -q -DskipTests package && cd ../..
```

The Python smoke tests (`sdks/python/tests/test_smoke.py`) cover:
- Every API class imports.
- No stale split-tag classes leak (regression for v26.5.4 where the
  generator left zombie `IngestApi` / `SchemaApi` after the spec
  split).
- `FlyqueryClient` exposes every v1 accessor.

The Java SDK test (`FlyqueryClientTest.java`) covers builder +
sibling-client behaviour + every accessor.

### 5. The CI gates the tag will run

| Workflow | Trigger | Jobs |
|---|---|---|
| `pr-gate.yaml` | every PR + push to main | lint, typecheck (advisory), unit, integration (testcontainers Postgres+Redis+MinIO), lockstep, sdk-python, sdk-java |
| `docker-publish.yaml` | push to main + `v*.*.*` tags | linux/amd64 + linux/arm64 image to GHCR |
| `publish-sdks.yaml` | `v*.*.*` tags only | Java to GitHub Packages, Python wheel/sdist to Release assets |

If `pr-gate` is green on `main` before you tag, the tag-driven
workflows essentially can't fail (they share the same checkout
+ vendor setup).

## Tag + push sequence

```bash
# Final commit
git add -A
git status                       # eyeball
git commit -m "release: v26.5.10

- v1 history/billing/stats endpoints
- RetentionWorker (TTL sweep + stuck-job reaper)
- Worker CLI (ingest|retention|all)
- 21 new tests (311 total)
- Schema-detection + workers docs
- SDK helpers for every v1 endpoint
"

# Push the branch
git push origin main

# Tag the release
git tag -a v26.5.10 -m "v26.5.10: v1 endpoints + RetentionWorker + worker CLI"
git push origin v26.5.10
```

Watch the three workflows on GitHub Actions. Total wall-clock:
~7-10 minutes (integration tests are the longest job at ~5 min).

## Post-release sanity

```bash
# Image is multi-arch -- pull on Apple Silicon + amd64 staging
docker pull ghcr.io/firefly-operationos/flyquery:v26.5.10
docker run --rm ghcr.io/firefly-operationos/flyquery:v26.5.10 flyquery version

# Python SDK from Release asset
uv add https://github.com/firefly-operationOS/flyquery/releases/download/v26.5.10/flyquery_sdk-26.5.10-py3-none-any.whl

# Java SDK from GitHub Packages
# (settings.xml must have the firefly-operationOS GitHub Packages repo)
mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.firefly:flyquery-sdk:26.5.10
```

## Rollback

The deploy is image + SDK -- no in-flight DB migration assumed
(if there's a new Alembic revision, that runs at boot via
`docker-entrypoint.sh`).

To roll back:
1. Re-tag the previous release: `docker tag :v26.5.9 :latest && push`
2. SDK consumers pin to the previous version explicitly (we never
   delete published artifacts).

The migrations chain is forward-compatible by construction
(`migrations/versions/*` is linear; downgrades exist for every
revision).

## Things to verify post-tag

- [ ] `pr-gate` green on main (must run BEFORE the tag push triggers
      `docker-publish` + `publish-sdks`)
- [ ] `docker-publish` produced both arch manifests
- [ ] `publish-sdks` Java job published to GitHub Packages
- [ ] `publish-sdks` Python job uploaded wheel + sdist to the Release
- [ ] GitHub Release page shows the auto-generated notes
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md `[X.Y.Z]` section matches what shipped
