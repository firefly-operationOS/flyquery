### **Tabular Intelligence**

**Conversational SQL over the files your business actually has.**

Drop a CSV, XLSX, JSON or Parquet into a workspace. flyquery infers
the schema, materialises the file as columnar Parquet on object
storage and indexes it in a long-lived knowledge base of tables,
columns, AI-proposed joins, business glossary and semantic-layer
metrics — then answers natural-language questions through a
multi-agent pipeline (Grounding → Generation → Critic → Explainer)
that produces governed DuckDB SQL with row-level audit, tenant
isolation and per-token scopes. One HTTP service, multi-tenant from
the first call. Format coverage: CSV, TSV, XLSX, XLS, ODS, JSON,
JSONL, Parquet, Avro, ORC, Arrow and Feather, plus their `.gz`,
`.zip` and `.bz2` variants.

## Why this service exists

Analysts answering ad-hoc questions live in two worlds:

1. **Spreadsheets** — fast to start, impossible to govern. Excel and CSV
   tabs accumulate in inboxes; nobody knows which version is current,
   which column means what, or whether the numbers can be trusted.
2. **Warehouses + BI tools** — governed but expensive. Onboarding a
   new dataset means an ETL ticket, a dbt model, a schema review, and
   weeks before the first dashboard ships.

flyquery is the **middle path**. Drop a CSV (or XLSX, or JSON, or
Parquet) into a workspace; flyquery materialises it as Parquet on
object storage, derives a typed schema, samples + profiles each
column, runs a PII pass, proposes joins to your other tables, and
fits it to a long-lived knowledge base. Then you ask in English. A
multi-agent pipeline (Grounding → Generation → Critic → Explainer)
produces governed DuckDB SQL, runs it in a sandboxed connection
under per-token scopes, returns rows + a chart hint, and keeps a
conversation thread for drill-down.

You get the governance of a warehouse (RLS, audit, scopes,
versioned schemas, semantic-layer metrics) and the time-to-first-
answer of a spreadsheet (upload, ask, done).

What makes this non-trivial:

- **Structured data is messy.** Real-world files have inconsistent headers,
  mixed date formats, merged cells, compressed archives, and multi-sheet XLSX
  with completely different schemas per sheet.
- **Re-uploads break queries.** Column renames across versions silently break
  historical analytics. flyquery detects drifts, preserves annotations, and
  pins historical queries to specific Parquet snapshots.
- **SQL generation is unreliable.** A single-pass LLM call mis-identifies
  tables, invents columns, and silently drops GROUP BY. flyquery uses a
  four-agent pipeline with an AST firewall and self-correcting Critic to ensure
  only valid, scoped SQL executes.

## Why not part of flycanon?

flycanon and flyquery are deliberately separate services that solve fundamentally
different problems. Combining them would create a coherent-looking mess.

**flycanon** is the operational knowledge repository for **unstructured** content
(documents, HTML, PDFs, audio transcripts). Its model is: docs → chunks →
embeddings → hybrid retrieval → grounded answers with citations. The query
language is natural-language-to-RAG. The storage engine is pgvector + BM25 over
text chunks. The retrieval primitive is semantic chunk retrieval with candidate
scoring. The user-facing concepts are knowledge items, candidates, and
supersession.

**flyquery** handles **structured tabular data**. Its model is: file → typed
schema → Parquet on object storage → DuckDB SQL via multi-agent pipeline. The
query language is natural-language-to-SQL. The storage engine is Parquet on
object storage queried in-process by DuckDB. The retrieval primitive is
schema-element retrieval + table resolution + AST firewall. The user-facing
concepts are datasets, tables, snapshots, examples, and metrics.

The query languages, storage engines, retrieval primitives, and user-facing
concepts conflict on every layer. Keeping them separate lets each service be sharp
at its one job. Cross-service handoff happens via the agent tier with idempotency;
see [`docs/integration-with-firefly-os.md`](docs/integration-with-firefly-os.md).

Three tiers: **upload surface** (async ingest into object storage + schema KB),
**query surface** (multi-agent NL→SQL over Parquet), **annotation surface**
(human governance of descriptions, PII tags, relations, examples).

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for the full walkthrough including credentials,
MinIO bucket setup, and environment variables.

```bash
# 1. Boot
task dev && task migrate && task serve
```

```bash

## Local dev

```bash
task dev          # docker compose up postgres + redis + minio
task migrate      # alembic upgrade head
task serve        # uvicorn flyquery.main:app --reload
```

### Running tests

```bash
task lint
task test:unit
task test:integration
```

Integration tests require Docker (testcontainers spins up `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`).
Tests marked `@pytest.mark.s3` / `@pytest.mark.gcs` / `@pytest.mark.azure_blob`
need local credentials or MinIO/fake-gcs/Azurite — see [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md).

Tests marked `@pytest.mark.llm` require `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Exclude them in CI
with `-m 'not llm'`.

## Architecture quick-take

flyquery uses a **two-tier storage design**: Parquet on object storage (LocalFs in
dev; S3/GCS/Azure Blob in production) queried by DuckDB in-process per request.
Postgres stores all metadata, embeddings, relations, audit, and agent tokens.
There is no persistent DuckDB database — every query ATTACHes Parquet snapshots
fresh, eliminating shared mutable state between requests.

The **hexagonal adapter ring** means every external boundary (object store, file
reader, vector store, PII scanner, semantic compiler, rate limiter) is a Python
`Protocol`; the domain core never depends on a concrete implementation.

Lock-step modules (`web/conventions/*`, `agent_deps.py`, `agent_token_service.py`,
`builder.py`) are byte-equivalent with flycanon and flyradar. A CI gate
(`scripts/check_lockstep.py`) blocks PRs that drift.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full picture.
